Server Scripts, Local Scripts and Module Scripts. There are differences between these type of scripts but that will be addressed later on in the guide. To start off, open Roblox Studio. When Roblox Studio is opened look to the side of your screen. You should see a service named ServerScriptService . Hover over this and right click on it, then click on Insert Object . Now, search for Script . Once it is in ServerScriptService you should be in the Script Editor . If you clicked off the script you can always double click on the script to open it back in the script editor! Variables Variables are a key component of programming. They are useful as they hold values that can be used later on. In Lua there are two types of variables. Local and Global variables. These type of variables has differences but that will be covered later on in the guide. However, It is good practice to always use local variables whenever possible of numerous reasons. To define a local variable you write the following: local Greeting = \"Hello World!\" Greeting is the name of the variable we have just created. This is important as later on in the script you can reference this Greeting variable and do anything with it. The value of the variable Greeting is Hello World! . To have the value of variable Greeting to be show to you can do this. local Greeting = \"Hello World!\" print ( Greeting ) -- Look in your output window In your output (Located at the bottom of your screen), you should see Hello World! . The value Greeting hold's has a data type. Data types will be mentioned later on in this guide. Data types Data types are used in function parameters and variable defintions. There are many different data types. Strings You can define strings by surrounding the text with either \" or ' . For multi-line strings, you can use [[ and ]] but not often used.","title":"Making your first script!"},{"location":"sc/#how-to-make-a-script","text":"Roblox has 3 different types of scripts.
